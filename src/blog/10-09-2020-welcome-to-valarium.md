Valarium community blog is the dedicated space for our community creators! It belongs to **you**, community members. There's not much to say here. I've been working on this blog for quite some time and today we announce it. Finally!

## Technical notes

NetlifyCMS is the backend behind the scenes. It takes the Markdown files from the editor/admin page, creates PR commits to the root git repo, and when published moves the markdown files to the /blog folder, starting the build & deploy phase afterwards in which Gatsby handles the generation of static HTML from `.sass`, `.md`, and media files.

## How to become a creator

If you'd like for your posts to be published on our blog, just send us a messsage! Whether you're a guest, or an active member of the community, your posts have a spot. The acceptance criteria is not 100% clear yet, but we're working on it. Feel free to ping me on Discord **Sovereign#4984** or @ me on Twitter **@nabil_tharwat16**. You can also use the contact form on the [contact page](/contact).

There's a dedicated channel on the server, `#blog`, in which you can post full blog posts and if wanted, you can ask us to share it on the blog for you as well.

Happy blogging!
